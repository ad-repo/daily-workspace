meta_guidelines:
  purpose: "Defines all coding, testing, documentation, and cleanup standards for the AI code editor."
  enforcement:
    - Always reference these rules after every operation, edit, or commit.
    - After each code generation, verify:
      - All relevant rules are followed.
      - Critical requirements are satisfied.
      - No drift or deviations exist.
    - Prioritize any section marked as `critical: true` when conflicts occur.
    - Optionally summarize rule compliance when outputting results.

rules:
  safety:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Prevent loss or corruption of working code, data, or functionality during edits, refactors, or cleanup."
    principles:
      - Never change program code to fix tests
      - Never modify or delete working code unless the change is fully understood and justified.
      - Never attempt optimizations or refactors without confirming tests pass before and after.
      - Never perform large deletions or rewrites without version control commits or backups.
      - Always review the impact of changes on dependent modules, APIs, and data flows.
      - Preserve existing functionality before implementing improvements.
      - If uncertain about side effects, isolate the change in a feature branch and test thoroughly.
      - Treat working code as production-critical unless explicitly marked for removal.
    safeguards:
      - Commit or stash all changes before running cleanup or migrations.
      - Use `git diff` or similar tools to confirm no unrelated code is altered.
      - Verify no regressions in functionality or performance after edits.
      - Avoid destructive bulk operations (e.g., search-replace, auto-fix, reformat) without previewing changes.
      - Revert immediately if tests or builds fail after a structural edit.
      - Escalate or review risky changes with a maintainer before proceeding.
    enforcement:
      - If a proposed action risks destroying working functionality, stop and request human review.
      - Roll back any accidental destructive change immediately.
      - Never prioritize speed or cleanliness over stability.
      - Always confirm safety compliance before committing or merging.

  database_changes:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Maintain database integrity and compatibility during schema or migration changes."
    steps:
      - Add migration scripts to backend/migrations/
      - Ensure migrations upgrade cleanly from all previous versions
      - Update backup/restore logic in backend/app/routers/backup.py
      - Test migrations on a database copy before committing
      - Verify backward compatibility or clearly document breaking changes

  code_quality:
    purpose: "Maintain consistent, error-free, production-ready code."
    checks:
      - Run linter before committing
      - Fix all linter errors (no exceptions)
      - Keep TypeScript strict mode enabled
      - Disallow console.log in production (except for critical errors)

  code_consistency:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Ensure all code follows existing project conventions and established patterns."
    rules:
      - Follow existing patterns and styles
      - Check for similar implementations before adding new features
      - Keep UI elements visually and structurally consistent
      - Match naming conventions, file structure, and organization
      - Do not introduce new patterns when one already exists

  ui_ux:
    purpose: "Maintain consistent and accessible user interfaces."
    standards:
      - Use consistent toggle and button styles
      - Use theme variables (var(--color-*)); never hardcoded colors
      - Ensure responsive design in both wide and compact layouts
      - Store user preferences in localStorage where appropriate

  context_state:
    purpose: "Handle shared and local state safely and predictably."
    guidelines:
      - Use React Context for global data (themes, settings, preferences)
      - Keep state local when sharing is not required
      - Provide default values for all localStorage items
      - Clean up effects, intervals, and listeners

  git_workflow:
    purpose: "Maintain clean and traceable version control practices."
    steps:
      - Create branches from main: feature/descriptive-name
      - Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
      - Never force push to main/master without approval
      - Check git status before committing
      - Verify pull requests can merge cleanly

  before_pushing:
    purpose: "Final verification checklist before pushing or merging changes."
    checklist:
      - Fix all linter errors
      - Add database migrations if schema changed
      - Update backup/restore scripts if data model changed
      - Update documentation and README as needed
      - Verify existing docs are accurate
      - Remove hardcoded credentials or API keys
      - Follow established patterns and styles
      - Verify all tests pass locally
      - Remove unused or outdated files

  file_organization:
    purpose: "Maintain consistent file structure across frontend and backend."
    layout:
      components: frontend/src/components/
      contexts: frontend/src/contexts/
      hooks: frontend/src/hooks/
      routers: backend/app/routers/
      migrations: backend/migrations/

  documentation:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Keep all documentation accurate, up to date, and aligned with implementation, including cases revealed by test results."
    applies_to:
      - Adding or modifying features
      - Fixing or refactoring code that changes behavior
      - Adjusting tests that expose behavior mismatches
      - Updating configuration, interfaces, or data models
    requirements:
      - Update .md files and READMEs whenever code behavior changes, even if discovered during test fixes.
      - Update external or internal documentation when tests reveal undocumented functionality or spec drift.
      - Document how tests map to features, expected outputs, and known edge cases.
      - Keep migration and usage guides in sync with actual runtime behavior.
      - Add inline code comments if a test fix clarifies unclear logic.
      - Clearly mark deprecated behavior identified during testing.
    verification:
      - After any test change, confirm that documentation still accurately describes system behavior.
      - Cross-check test expectations and documented behavior for alignment.
      - Ensure test examples in docs (if any) run and pass.
    enforcement:
      - Treat missing or outdated docs after test updates as blockers for merge.
      - Never dismiss documentation updates as “not needed” for test changes; documentation reflects reality, not intent.
      - Re-verify documentation alignment after all test-related code merges.

  external_docs_discovery:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Ensure the model automatically locates and uses relevant external documentation before implementing, modifying, or validating functionality."
    applies_to:
      - Implementing new features, routes, or APIs
      - Fixing or refactoring existing logic
      - Adjusting tests that expose discrepancies with documented behavior
      - Resolving spec drift between tests, code, and documentation
      - Any situation where expected vs actual behavior diverges
    principles:
      - Always locate and review authoritative documentation before coding or fixing behavior.
      - Treat discovery of relevant docs as part of both feature implementation and test correction.
      - Never assume undocumented behavior is correct; confirm with the official spec or source documentation.
      - Prefer internal or official documentation over general references.
      - If documentation cannot be found for a behavior under test, flag it as a possible gap and request clarification.
    search_behavior:
      - Determine documentation relevance based on context (file path, module name, API, data model, or test subject).
      - Search known locations first:
        - `/docs/`, `/api/`, `/spec/`, `/design/`, `/architecture/`
        - Linked internal wikis or Confluence pages
        - External SDK or API portals
      - Use semantic cues from test names, API routes, and code identifiers to locate relevant docs.
      - Retrieve the smallest necessary snippet defining the relevant functionality.
      - Confirm the document version matches the tested or implemented code version.
    implementation_guidelines:
      - Reference discovered documentation explicitly when making changes.
      - Verify code and tests align with documented request/response schemas, data types, and expected outputs.
      - Mirror documented examples for payloads, responses, and error handling.
      - Record documentation version, title, and source in commit or PR notes for traceability.
      - If test failures indicate undocumented behavior, update documentation references or flag the gap.
    enforcement:
      - Treat missing or outdated documentation as a blocker for merge when behavior differs from expectations.
      - Stop implementation or test updates if authoritative documentation cannot be located.
      - Escalate discrepancies between documentation and actual code/tests rather than guessing intent.
      - Always re-verify alignment with documentation after test fixes, refactors, or API updates.

  test_creation:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Ensure all new or modified functionality includes automated test coverage without being prompted."
    triggers:
      - Adding new features, routes, or components
      - Modifying existing logic or algorithms
      - Refactoring code that affects behavior
      - Fixing bugs or implementing missing functionality
      - Changing database schema or data models
    requirements:
      - Create or update unit, integration, or UI tests for new or changed behavior
      - Ensure tests reflect expected functionality and edge cases
      - Place new test files in the correct directories
      - Maintain consistent test naming and structure
      - Include both positive and negative test cases
      - Update mocks, fixtures, or stubs as needed
      - Do not skip test creation, even for small changes or bug fixes
    quality_standards:
      - New tests must pass and integrate with the full suite
      - Tests must clearly express intent (no vague or placeholder assertions)
      - Avoid redundant or overlapping tests
      - Maintain or improve test coverage where possible
      - Ensure tests run quickly and reliably in CI
    enforcement:
      - Missing tests for new functionality are blockers for merge or commit
      - If unsure how to test, request review or guidance—do not skip
      - Never release untested new functionality
      - When uncertain, add more tests rather than fewer

  testing:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Ensure correctness, reliability, and meaningful coverage without altering valid logic."
    when_to_run:
      - Do not change program code to fix tests 
      - Run all tests for the current section when major changes are made
      - Run all shared library tests after any modification
      - Run the full suite before pushing any code
    rules:
      - Do not modify or simplify valid tests to make them pass
      - Do not rename or rewrite test titles to match incorrect behavior
      - Do not run long-running tests that always time out unless fixing them
      - Never skip or delete tests without explicit approval
      - Test functionality must match its title and intent
      - All tests must pass before pushing or merging
    quality_standards:
      - Identify and call out stub, placeholder, or trivial tests that provide no meaningful verification
      - Flag tests that use empty assertions, overly generic names, or lack clear expectations
      - Replace or request improvements for tests that exist only to satisfy coverage metrics
      - Ensure each test verifies a specific behavior or outcome, not just execution success
      - Verify that test data, mocks, and fixtures are realistic and relevant
      - Maintain clear, descriptive test names that communicate purpose and scope
      - Prefer focused, behavior-driven tests over broad or redundant ones
    collaboration:
      - Report unclear test failures instead of changing logic
      - Raise issues or comments for low-quality tests that need redesign
      - Review bugs, missing features, or unclear expectations before code changes
    crosslinks:
      - When fixing failing tests, recheck rules.external_docs_discovery to confirm behavior aligns with documentation
    enforcement:
      - If test rules conflict with other rules, this section takes priority
      - Validate test behavior against expected functionality, not current output
      - Treat low-quality or stub tests as technical debt; do not consider them "passing coverage"

  local_test_execution:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Never run tests locally - all tests must run in containers via the test script"
    rules:
      - Never execute docker-compose run --rm e2e npx playwright test
      - Never execute npm test or pytest or python -m pytest directly
      - Never run any test commands that could interfere with the user's local environment
      - Only reference ./run_all_tests.sh when discussing tests
      - User will run ./run_all_tests.sh themselves when needed
    enforcement:
      - Any test execution command is a critical violation - stop immediately
      - If test results are needed, ask the user to run ./run_all_tests.sh
      - Never run tests in background or foreground without explicit user instruction

  cleanup:
    critical: true
    purpose: "Keep the repository clean, efficient, and free of obsolete code or files."
    when_to_run:
      - Perform cleanup before every push or major merge
      - Run cleanup after large refactors, feature removals, or migration changes
    code_cleanup:
      - Remove unused imports, functions, and variables
      - Delete dead or unreachable code
      - Remove deprecated feature flags or conditionals
      - Verify removed code is not referenced in tests, docs, or configs
    file_cleanup:
      - Delete obsolete scripts and utilities
      - Remove temporary or local-use-only files (debug helpers, scratch code)
      - Delete outdated .md files for removed features or workflows
      - Keep only one canonical version of each doc or guide
      - Remove duplicate or outdated migration and backup scripts
    verification:
      - Search for unused files or modules
      - Confirm deletions are tracked by version control
      - Ensure no production dependencies rely on deleted files
      - Verify build and test pipelines pass after cleanup
    enforcement:
      - Treat cleanup warnings as blockers before pushing
      - Never delete code, docs, or files without verifying no references remain
      - If uncertain about a file, mark it deprecated instead of deleting
