# Cursor Rules for Track the Thing

## Database Changes
- **CRITICAL**: Any change involving database schema modifications MUST include:
  - Proper migration scripts in `backend/migrations/`
  - Migration script must handle upgrades from all previous versions
  - Update all backup/restore scripts in `backend/app/routers/backup.py`
  - Test migration on a copy of the database before committing
  - Verify backward compatibility or document breaking changes

## Code Quality
- Run linter checks before committing
- Fix all linter errors - no exceptions
- Keep TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No console.log statements in production code (except critical errors)

## UI/UX Standards
- All toggle buttons must have consistent styling across the app
- Use theme variables (var(--color-*)) instead of hardcoded colors
- Maintain responsive design - test in both wide and compact modes
- Preserve user preferences in localStorage where appropriate

## Context & State Management
- Use React Context for global state (themes, settings, user preferences)
- Keep component state local when it doesn't need to be shared
- Always provide default values for localStorage items
- Clean up effects and intervals properly

## Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
- No force push to main/master without explicit approval
- Always check `git status` before committing

## Before Pushing
- [ ] All linter errors fixed
- [ ] Database migrations created (if schema changed)
- [ ] Backup/restore scripts updated (if data model changed)
- [ ] No hardcoded sensitive data or API keys
- [ ] README/docs updated if new features added
- [ ] Test in development environment

## File Organization
- Components in `frontend/src/components/`
- Contexts in `frontend/src/contexts/`
- Custom hooks in `frontend/src/hooks/`
- Backend routers in `backend/app/routers/`
- Migrations in `backend/migrations/` with incremental numbering

## Testing
- Test user flows manually before pushing
- Verify theme compatibility across all new UI elements
- Check mobile/responsive layouts
- Test with existing data (not just fresh installs)

## Documentation
- Update relevant .md files when adding major features
- Keep migration guides up to date
- Document breaking changes prominently
- Add inline comments for complex logic
